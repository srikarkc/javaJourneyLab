Lambda expressions provide a clear and concise way to implement interfaces with a single abstract method (commonly known as functional interfaces). Lambda expressions are often used to create anonymous methods easily.

### Understanding Lambda Expressions

A lambda expression is composed of three parts:

1. **Argument List**: It can be empty or non-empty as well.
2. **Arrow Token (`->`)**: It links arguments list and body of expression.
3. **Body**: Contains expressions and statements for the lambda expression.

Syntax: `(argument-list) -> {body}`

### Example: Car Factory Program

Let's create an example where we use lambda expressions in a car factory program. 

#### Step 1: Define a Functional Interface

A functional interface is an interface with a single abstract method. In our case, let's define an interface for creating a car.

```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface CarFactory {
    Car createCar(String model, String color);
}
```

Here, `CarFactory` is a functional interface with a single method that takes a model and color and returns a new `Car` object.

#### Step 2: Define the Car Class

Now, let's define a simple `Car` class.

```java
public class Car {
    private String model;
    private String color;

    public Car(String model, String color) {
        this.model = model;
        this.color = color;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Car{" +
               "model='" + model + '\'' +
               ", color='" + color + '\'' +
               '}';
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Implementing with Lambda Expressions

Now, we can use a lambda expression to implement the `CarFactory` interface.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CarFactory carFactory = (model, color) -> new Car(model, color);

        Car myCar = carFactory.createCar("Tesla Model S", "Red");
        System.out.println(myCar);
    }
}
```

In this example, `(model, color) -> new Car(model, color)` is a lambda expression that implements the `CarFactory` interface. It takes two parameters (`model` and `color`) and returns a new `Car` object.

#### How It Works

- The lambda expression `(model, color) -> new Car(model, color)` matches the signature of the `createCar` method in the `CarFactory` interface.
- When `carFactory.createCar("Tesla Model S", "Red")` is called, it invokes the lambda expression with the provided arguments, creating a new `Car` object.

Lambda expressions make it easy to instantiate functional interfaces and are especially useful in stream operations, event listeners, and implementing simple interface methods with minimal code.
