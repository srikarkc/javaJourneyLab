Working with networking in Java involves using classes from the `java.net` package, which provides support for networking functionalities including sockets, which are the fundamental building blocks for network communication.

### Basic Concepts in Java Networking
1. **IP Address**: A numerical label assigned to each device in a network.
2. **Port Number**: A way to identify specific processes or network services.
3. **Socket**: An endpoint for communication between two machines.
4. **ServerSocket**: A class used by servers to obtain client connections.

### Socket Programming
Socket programming is commonly used for enabling communication between client and server applications.

#### 1. **Creating a Server**
- **ServerSocket**: Used to create a server that listens for incoming client requests.
- **Accepting Connections**: The server's `accept()` method waits and accepts a connection from a client.
- Example:
  ```java
  ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(portNumber);
  Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();
  ```

#### 2. **Creating a Client**
- **Socket**: Used to create a client that can connect to a server.
- **Connecting to Server**: The client uses the server's IP address and port number to establish a connection.
- Example:
  ```java
  Socket socket = new Socket("127.0.0.1", portNumber);
  ```

#### 3. **Data Communication**
- **Streams**: Use `InputStream` and `OutputStream` for communication.
- **Reading/Writing**: The client and server can read from and write to each other through these streams.
- Example:
  ```java
  // On Server
  PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(clientSocket.getOutputStream(), true);
  BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(clientSocket.getInputStream()));

  // On Client
  PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);
  BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));
  ```

### Example: Echo Server
Hereâ€™s a simple example of a client-server application where the server echoes back any message it receives from the client.

#### Server Code
```java
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;

public class EchoServer {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        int portNumber = 1234; // Or any other port

        try (ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(portNumber);
             Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();
             PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(clientSocket.getOutputStream(), true);
             BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(clientSocket.getInputStream()))) {
            
            String inputLine;
            while ((inputLine = in.readLine()) != null) {
                out.println(inputLine);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Exception caught when trying to listen on port " + portNumber + " or listening for a connection");
            System.out.println(e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

#### Client Code
```java
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;

public class EchoClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        String hostName = "127.0.0.1"; // Server IP
        int portNumber = 1234; // Port Number

        try (Socket echoSocket = new Socket(hostName, portNumber);
             PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(echoSocket.getOutputStream(), true);
             BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(echoSocket.getInputStream()));
             BufferedReader stdIn = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in))) {

            String userInput;
            while ((userInput = stdIn.readLine()) != null) {
                out.println(userInput);
                System.out.println("echo: " + in.readLine());
            }
        } catch (UnknownHostException e) {
            System.err.println("Don't know about host " + hostName);
            System.exit(1);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Couldn't get I/O for the connection to " + hostName);
            System.exit(1);
        }
    }
}
```

### Key Points to Remember
- Exception handling is crucial in network programming to handle cases like network errors, connection loss, etc.
- It's important to close sockets and streams after communication ends to free up resources.
- When working with real-world applications, consider threads or executors for handling multiple client connections simultaneously.

By understanding these basics, you can expand into more complex networking tasks in Java, like handling multiple clients, securing connections with SSL/TLS, and working with non-blocking I/O.
