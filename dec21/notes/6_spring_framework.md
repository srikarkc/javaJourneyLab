### 1. **Understanding Dependency Injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IoC)**
   - **Concept**: Inversion of Control (IoC) is a principle where the control of objects is transferred to a container or framework. Dependency Injection is a design pattern used for implementing IoC.
   - **Practice**: Create simple Java classes and inject dependencies using Spring's IoC container.

### 2. **Spring Core Concepts**
   - **Beans**: The fundamental building blocks of a Spring application. Understand bean lifecycle, scopes, and properties.
   - **ApplicationContext**: Learn about the Spring container that provides bean management and wiring.
   - **Configuration**: Focus on XML configuration and Annotation-based configuration.

### 3. **Data Access with Spring**
   - **JDBC**: Understand how Spring simplifies data access with JDBC.
   - **Transactions**: Learn transaction management with Spring, both programmatic and declarative.
   - **Spring Data JPA**: Explore Spring's integration with JPA for object-relational mapping.

### 4. **Building Web Applications with Spring MVC**
   - **Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern**: Understand the MVC architecture in Spring.
   - **Controllers**: Learn how to create controllers and handle HTTP requests.
   - **Views**: Explore view resolution and different view technologies (e.g., Thymeleaf, JSP).
   - **Form Handling**: Understand form submissions and validations in Spring MVC.

### 5. **Spring Boot**
   - **Introduction**: Learn how Spring Boot simplifies Spring application setup and configuration.
   - **Auto-Configuration**: Understand how Spring Boot auto-configures beans based on classpath settings.
   - **Spring Boot Starters**: Use starters for easy dependency management.
   - **Building RESTful Services**: Develop RESTful APIs using Spring Boot.

### 6. **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)**
   - **Concepts**: Understand the principles of AOP.
   - **Implementing Aspects**: Learn how to implement cross-cutting concerns like logging and transaction management.

### 7. **Advanced Topics**
   - **Spring Security**: Basics of authentication and authorization.
   - **Microservices with Spring Cloud**: Understand how Spring supports building microservices.
   - **Reactive Programming**: Explore Spring WebFlux for building non-blocking, reactive applications.

### 8. **Testing**
   - **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests for Spring components using JUnit.
   - **Integration Testing**: Learn to test the integration of different layers in your application.

### 9. **Project Building and Dependency Management**
   - **Maven/Gradle**: Understand how to build and manage dependencies in a Spring project.

### 10. **Practical Application**
   - **Develop a Project**: Apply what you've learned in a practical project. For example, create a web application using Spring MVC or a RESTful service with Spring Boot.
