### 1. **Understanding Dependency Injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IoC)**
   - **Concept**: Inversion of Control (IoC) is a principle where the control of objects is transferred to a container or framework. Dependency Injection is a design pattern used for implementing IoC.
   - **Practice**: Create simple Java classes and inject dependencies using Spring's IoC container.

   Dependency Injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IoC) are fundamental concepts in the Spring Framework, often used interchangeably but they have distinct meanings. Let's understand these concepts using the Car Factory example we discussed earlier.

### Inversion of Control (IoC)
IoC is a principle where the control of objects is transferred from a program's main body to a container or framework. In traditional programming, your code is responsible for the flow of the application and creating and managing objects. With IoC, this control is inverted â€“ the framework creates and manages objects.

In our Car Factory example:
- Without IoC: You would create `Car` objects directly in your code.
- With IoC: The creation of `Car` objects is handled by an external entity (like the Spring container).

### Dependency Injection (DI)
DI is a design pattern used to implement IoC. It involves injecting dependencies (services, resources, etc.) into components (like classes) rather than having the components create or find the dependencies themselves.

In the Car Factory example, let's consider `Car` depends on an `Engine` component.

#### Without Dependency Injection:
```java
public class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    public Car() {
        this.engine = new Engine(); // Car is responsible for creating its own Engine
    }
}

public class Engine {
    // Engine implementation
}
```

#### With Dependency Injection:
```java
public class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine; // Engine is injected into Car
    }
}

public class Engine {
    // Engine implementation
}
```

In the DI example, `Car` does not create an `Engine` itself. Instead, it's provided (or injected) into `Car` when it's constructed. This decouples the creation of the dependent object (`Engine`) from the class that uses it (`Car`), making the code more modular, testable, and maintainable.

### Implementing IoC and DI in Spring
In Spring, IoC is achieved using the Spring IoC container, which manages beans (objects). DI is performed by the container via constructors, setters, or fields.

#### Spring Configuration
You can configure Spring beans and dependencies using XML configuration or annotations (e.g., `@Component`, `@Autowired`).

#### XML Configuration Example:
```xml
<bean id="engine" class="com.example.Engine" />

<bean id="car" class="com.example.Car">
    <constructor-arg ref="engine"/>
</bean>
```

#### Annotation-Based Configuration Example:
```java
@Component
public class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    @Autowired
    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }
}

@Component
public class Engine {
    // Engine implementation
}
```

In the annotation example, `@Component` tells Spring that `Car` and `Engine` are beans. `@Autowired` on the constructor of `Car` indicates that the `Engine` dependency should be automatically injected by Spring.

### Key Takeaways
- **IoC in Spring**: The framework manages object creation and wiring, allowing you to focus on business logic.
- **DI in Spring**: Dependencies are injected by Spring, promoting loose coupling and easier testing.
- **Configurations**: Spring's DI can be configured using XML or annotations, with annotations being the modern approach.

By understanding and applying IoC and DI, you can develop loosely coupled, easily testable, and maintainable applications using Spring.
